building LLM from scratch

📘 Lecture 1 Notes

Course Title: Build a Large Language Model from Scratch
Instructor: Dr. Raj Dander
Institutional Background:

B.Tech, Indian Institute of Technology Madras (2017)

PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2022)

Mission: Make AI accessible to everyone through free, beginner-friendly content.

🧑‍🏫 1. Course Introduction

Goal of the series:
To teach how to build a large language model (LLM) from scratch, starting from the basics, without assuming any prior deep knowledge.

Motivation:

LLMs and generative AI are transforming industries.

Most learners jump directly to applications without understanding the core concepts.

Building an LLM from scratch helps you gain confidence and deep understanding.

Philosophy of the course:

Teach everything step by step (nuts and bolts).

Use detailed lecture notes + free video lectures.

No shortcuts—solid foundation first.

🕰️ 2. Evolution of LLMs — A Look Back

Early NLP example: ELIZA (1960s)

A chatbot therapist program.

Limited understanding — repeated or generic responses.

Today: ChatGPT

Gives relevant, useful, structured answers.

Illustrates how far LLMs have evolved.

🌍 3. Generative AI and LLMs Today

Major advancement:

Open-source vs closed-source LLMs.

Open-source models like LLaMA 3.1 have achieved performance close to GPT-4.

Closed-source: Not fully transparent (e.g., OpenAI models).

Open-source: Architecture and weights are public — good for learners.

Generative AI covers more than text:

Video

Audio

Images

3D Models

Example: AI-generated videos and tools that automate tasks like MCQ generation for education.

📈 4. Growing Job Market

Generative AI & LLM skills are in very high demand.

Job opportunities are expected to grow 5–6× in the next 5 years.

📚 5. Learning Gaps in Existing Courses

Most online courses focus on:

App deployment using tools like LangChain.

Not on building core LLM architecture.

Lack of structured, beginner-friendly, fundamental courses.

📖 6. Reference Material for the Course

Primary book: Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

48 pages.

Will be converted into 50–60 lectures.

Final notes expected to be 200–300 pages.

🧠 7. Course Plan & Goals

Build your own GPT-like model from scratch.

Understand every concept (e.g., key-query-value, positional encoding).

Be able to explain LLM internals confidently in interviews.

Focus on:

Fundamentals

Architecture understanding

Practical building

Real-world applications after the core foundation is strong.

📝 8. What to Expect in Next Lectures

Upcoming Topics:

Introduction to LLMs

Stages of building an LLM

Fundamentals of tokenization, embeddings, attention, transformers, etc.

Gradually move from theory → coding → building a working model.

✨ Extra Notes (Post-Class Understanding)
🧭 Why Understanding LLMs from Scratch Matters

If you only use LLMs (via APIs or prebuilt tools), your knowledge is limited.

If you build an LLM, you can:

Customize models for specific tasks.

Optimize cost and performance.

Stand out in interviews and projects.

🧠 Key Concepts to Review for Next Class

What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A neural network trained on massive text data to generate human-like language.

Examples: GPT series, LLaMA, Claude.

Generative AI vs LLMs:

Generative AI is broader (covers text, audio, video, images).

LLMs focus on text generation and understanding.

Open-source vs Closed-source Models:

Open-source (e.g., LLaMA): Accessible, transparent, customizable.

Closed-source (e.g., GPT-4): Limited access but often more refined.

Applications of LLMs:

Education, customer service, healthcare, content creation, programming assistance, etc.

🧰 Suggested Preparation for Next Lecture

Skim through the basic concepts of:

NLP history and early chatbot systems like ELIZA.

Transformer architecture (at a very high level).

Explore what tokenization means.

Look up the author Sebastian Raschka’s book overview to familiarize yourself.

✅ Summary of Lecture 1:

Course sets a strong foundational path to build your own LLM.

Shows why learning internals first is critical.

Introduces evolution from early chatbots → GPT era.

Highlights importance of open-source learning and the massive job opportunity in this field.

Sets expectations for detailed, structured, and beginner-friendly upcoming sessions.
